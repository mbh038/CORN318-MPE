    "text": "1.2 Ocean Acidification\n\n\n\nDoney 2020\n\n\nAt seawater pH levels (∼8), \\(\\ce{CO2}\\) added to seawater reacts with water to form bicarbonate \\(\\ce{HCO3-}\\) and hydrogen ions \\(\\ce{H+}\\):\n\\[\\ce{CO2 + H2O -&gt; H2CO3- + H+}\\] The release of \\(\\ce{H+}\\) acts to increase acidity and lower seawater pH, defined as\n\\[\\ce{pH}=-\\log_{10}\\ce{[H+]}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\npH: a measure of the acidity of water where lower pH reflects more acidic conditions; reported on a log-scale such that a 1-unit drop in pH is equivalent to a factor of 10 increase in acidity\n\n\nand lower the concentration of carbonate ions , via\n\\[\\ce{CO3^{2-} + H+  -&gt; HCO3-}\\] Acidification impacts will depend on organism responses to multiple, simultaneous chemical changes—increasing \\(\\ce{CO2}\\), \\(\\ce{HCO3-}\\) , and \\(\\ce{H+}\\) and decreasing \\(\\ce{CO3^{2-}}\\). Many types of marine organisms that form shells and skeletons from calcium carbonate (\\(\\ce{CaCO3}\\)) minerals are sensitive to acidification. The solubility of carbonate minerals,\n\\[\\ce{CaCO3 (s) &lt;-&gt; CO3^{2-} + Ca2+}\\]\ncan be expressed as a carbon saturation state\n\\[ \\Omega = \\frac{\\ce{[CO3^{2-}][Ca2+]}}{K_{sp}} \\]\nwhere \\(K_{sp}\\) is the apparent solubility product at a given temperature, salinity and pressure for each mineral form of \\(\\ce{CaCO3}\\). A value of \\(\\Omega\\) &lt; 1 indicates undersaturation with respect to thermodynamic equilibrium, and under those seawater conditions, unprotected carbonate materials will dissolve. The multiple forms of carbonate minerals vary in Ksp and so have different solubilities, with calcite being less soluble than aragonite and amorphous calcium carbonate. As \\(\\ce{CO2}\\) increases, the \\(\\ce{CO3^{2-}}\\) concentration declines because of consumption with \\(\\ce{H+}\\) (Equation 3) causing a decline in \\(\\Omega\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\naragonite and calcite are two mineral forms of calcium carbonate \\(\\ce{CaCO3}\\). Both are used by marine organisms in shell and skeleton formation by a biominerlization. Aragonite is the more soluble of the two, with rapid dissolution kinetics\n\n\nOcean surface waters exchange \\(\\ce{CO2}\\) with the overlying atmosphere via physical gas transfer, and the surface seawater partial pressure, \\(\\ce{pCO2}\\), tends to track the growth of atmospheric \\(\\ce{CO2}\\) for much of the global ocean, as illustrated by long-term time series records at numerous open-ocean locations (26) and analysis of global surface ocean \\(\\ce{CO2}\\) observational networks (27). As a result, surface pH and \\(\\ce{CO3^{2-}}\\) are declining, and surface ocean pH is estimated to have dropped on average globally by approximately 0.1 units from the preindustrial era to present, which is an ∼30% increase in hydrogen ion concentration.\nHence, as \\(\\Omega\\) declines, aragonite in particular becomes more soluble and aragonite calcareous shells of marine life forms become vulnerable to dissolving.\nStudies have already found evidence of extensive shell dissolution of the aragonite shells of the pteropod (small snails) Limacina helicina antarctica in the Southern Ocean, where undersaturation (ie \\(\\ce{Omega_{\\text{ar}}&lt;1})\\) of aragonite is now a reality (Lischka et al. 2025).",
