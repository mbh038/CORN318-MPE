# Ocean Acidification

Ocean acidification is one of the most significant threats to coral reefs worldwide. It is a direct consequence of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) levels, which are absorbed by the oceans. This process alters seawater chemistry, with profound impacts not only on coral reefs but on all calcifying marine organisms, their communities and ecosystems

Key papers for this topic include [@doney2020], [@mollica2018], [@orr2005], [@lischka2025] and [@royalsociety2005].

## Increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration

First, we note that atmospheric CO~2~ levels have risen by about 30% in the last 70 years, from around 300 pm to (now, in 2026) around 428 ppm, and are continuing to rise at a rate of about 2ppm per year. This rate of increase is, if anything, becoming greater.

The best place to see this is the site of the [Mauna Loa Observatory](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/) in Hawaii, where measurements of atmospheric CO~2~ have been going on continually since the late 1950s. From @fig-mlo we see that over this period there has been an annual cycle superimposed on a relentlessly rising trend.

## Seawater chemistry

The oceans absorb about 25-30% of the CO₂ emitted into the atmosphere. When CO₂ dissolves in seawater, it reacts with water to form carbonic acid, which dissociates into bicarbonate ions and hydrogen ions. The increase in atmospheric CO2 means that more CO2 is being absorbed by the oceans which means in turn that the concentration of hydrogen ions in the water is increasing. This means that the ocean is becoming more acidic, with reducd pH.

We see from @fig-doney, taken from [@doney2020] that ocean pH levels have dropped by about 0.1 over the last 30-40 years.

Let us explore how this happens.\
\

At seawater pH levels (∼8), $\ce{CO2}$ added to seawater reacts with water to form bicarbonate $\ce{HCO3-}$ and hydrogen ions $\ce{H+}$:

$$\ce{CO2 + H2O -> H2CO3- + H+}$$ The release of $\ce{H+}$ acts to increase acidity and lower seawater pH, defined as

$$\ce{pH}=-\log_{10}\ce{[H+]}$$

**pH**: a measure of the acidity of water where lower pH reflects more acidic conditions; reported on a log-scale such that a 1-unit drop in pH is equivalent to a factor of 10 increase in acidity

and lower the concentration of carbonate ions \ce{CO3^{2-}}, via

$$\ce{CO3^{2-} + H+  -> HCO3-}$$ Acidification impacts will depend on organism responses to multiple, simultaneous chemical changes—increasing $\ce{CO2}$, $\ce{HCO3-}$ , and $\ce{H+}$ and decreasing $\ce{CO3^{2-}}$. Many types of marine organisms that form shells and skeletons from calcium carbonate ($\ce{CaCO3}$) minerals are sensitive to acidification. The solubility of carbonate minerals,

$$\ce{CaCO3 (s) <-> CO3^{2-} + Ca2+}$$

can be expressed as a carbon saturation state

$$ \Omega = \frac{\ce{[CO3^{2-}][Ca2+]}}{K_{sp}} $$

where $K_{sp}$ is the apparent solubility product at a given temperature, salinity and pressure for each mineral form of $\ce{CaCO3}$. A value of $\Omega$ \< 1 indicates undersaturation with respect to thermodynamic equilibrium, and under those seawater conditions, unprotected carbonate materials will dissolve. The multiple forms of carbonate minerals vary in *K*~sp~ and so have different solubilities, with calcite being less soluble than aragonite and amorphous calcium carbonate. As $\ce{CO2}$ increases, the $\ce{CO3^{2-}}$ concentration declines because of consumption with $\ce{H+}$ (Equation 3) causing a decline in $\Omega$.

::: callout-note
**aragonite** and **calcite** are two mineral forms of calcium carbonate $\ce{CaCO3}$. Both are used by marine organisms in shell and skeleton formation by a biominerlization. Aragonite is the more soluble of the two, with rapid dissolution kinetics

Ocean surface waters exchange $\ce{CO2}$ with the overlying atmosphere via physical gas transfer, and the surface seawater partial pressure, $\ce{pCO2}$, tends to track the growth of atmospheric $\ce{CO2}$ for much of the global ocean, as illustrated by long-term time series records at numerous open-ocean locations and analysis of global surface ocean $\ce{CO2}$ observational networks. As a result, surface pH and $\ce{CO3^{2-}}$ are declining, and surface ocean pH is estimated to have dropped on average globally by approximately 0.1 units from the preindustrial era to present, which means there has been an ∼30% increase in hydrogen ion concentration. What? Yes. The oceans are now about 30% more acidic than they were just a few decades ago.

Hence, as $\Omega$ declines, aragonite in particular becomes more soluble and aragonite calcareous shells of marine life forms become vulnerable to dissolving.

Studies have already found evidence of extensive shell dissolution of the aragonite shells of the pteropod (small snails) *Limacina helicina antarctica* in the Southern Ocean, where undersaturation (ie $\ce{Omega_{\text{ar}}<1})$ of aragonite is now a reality [@lischka2025].
