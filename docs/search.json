    "text": "1.1 Increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration\nOcean acidification is one of the most significant threats to coral reefs worldwide. It is a direct consequence of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) levels, which are absorbed by the oceans. This process alters seawater chemistry, with profound impacts not only on coral reefs but on all calcifying marine organisms, their communities and ecosystems\nKey papers for this topic include (Doney et al. 2020), (Mollica et al. 2018), (Orr et al. 2005), (Lischka et al. 2025) and (Royal Society 2005).\nFirst, we note that atmospheric CO2 levels have risen by about 30% in the last 70 years, from around 300 pm to (now, in 2026) around 428 ppm, and are continuing to rise at a rate of about 2ppm per year. This rate of increase is, if anything, becoming greater. The increase is driven almost entirely by the release into the atmosphere of CO2 in the combustion of fossil fuels. Around 10 Gt carbon is now being released annually. The atmospheric concentration of CO2 is now at a level not experienced on Earth for several million years, and the rate of change in the last two hudred years is up to 100 times greater than the most rapid rates of change that occurred during transitions between glacial and interglacial periods.\nThe best place to see this is the site of the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, where measurements of atmospheric CO2 have been going on continually since the late 1950s. From Figure 1.1 we see that over this period there has been an annual cycle superimposed on a relentlessly rising trend.",

    "section": "1.2 Seawater chemistry",
    "text": "1.2 Seawater chemistry\nThe oceans absorb about 25-30% of the CO₂ emitted into the atmosphere. When CO₂ dissolves in seawater, it reacts with water to form carbonic acid, which dissociates into bicarbonate ions and hydrogen ions. The increase in atmospheric CO2 means that more CO2 is being absorbed by the oceans which means in turn that the concentration of hydrogen ions in the water is increasing. This means that the ocean is becoming more acidic, with reducd pH.\nWe see from Figure 1.2, taken from (Doney et al. 2020) that ocean pH levels have dropped by about 0.1 over the last 30-40 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Decline of ocean pH Doney et al. (2020)\n\n\n\nLet us explore how this happens.\n\n\nAt seawater pH levels (∼8), \\(\\ce{CO2}\\) added to seawater reacts with water to form bicarbonate \\(\\ce{HCO3-}\\) and hydrogen ions \\(\\ce{H+}\\):\n\\[\\ce{CO2 + H2O -&gt; H2CO3- + H+}\\] The release of \\(\\ce{H+}\\) acts to increase acidity and lower seawater pH, defined as\n\\[\\ce{pH}=-\\log_{10}\\ce{[H+]}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\npH: a measure of the acidity of water where lower pH reflects more acidic conditions; reported on a log-scale such that a 1-unit drop in pH is equivalent to a factor of 10 increase in acidity\n\n\nand lower the concentration of carbonate ions , via\n\\[\\ce{CO3^{2-} + H+  -&gt; HCO3-}\\] Acidification impacts will depend on organism responses to multiple, simultaneous chemical changes—increasing \\(\\ce{CO2}\\), \\(\\ce{HCO3-}\\) , and \\(\\ce{H+}\\) and decreasing \\(\\ce{CO3^{2-}}\\). Many types of marine organisms that form shells and skeletons from calcium carbonate (\\(\\ce{CaCO3}\\)) minerals are sensitive to acidification. The solubility of carbonate minerals,\n\\[\\ce{CaCO3 (s) &lt;-&gt; CO3^{2-} + Ca2+}\\]\ncan be expressed as a carbon saturation state\n\\[ \\Omega = \\frac{\\ce{[CO3^{2-}][Ca2+]}}{K_{sp}} \\]\nwhere \\(K_{sp}\\) is the apparent solubility product at a given temperature, salinity and pressure for each mineral form of \\(\\ce{CaCO3}\\). A value of \\(\\Omega\\) &lt; 1 indicates undersaturation with respect to thermodynamic equilibrium, and under those seawater conditions, unprotected carbonate materials will dissolve. The multiple forms of carbonate minerals vary in Ksp and so have different solubilities, with calcite being less soluble than aragonite and amorphous calcium carbonate. As \\(\\ce{CO2}\\) increases, the \\(\\ce{CO3^{2-}}\\) concentration declines because of consumption with \\(\\ce{H+}\\) (Equation 3) causing a decline in \\(\\Omega\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\naragonite and calcite are two mineral forms of calcium carbonate \\(\\ce{CaCO3}\\). Both are used by marine organisms in shell and skeleton formation by a biominerlization. Aragonite is the more soluble of the two, with rapid dissolution kinetics\n\n\nOcean surface waters exchange \\(\\ce{CO2}\\) with the overlying atmosphere via physical gas transfer, and the surface seawater partial pressure, \\(\\ce{pCO2}\\), tends to track the growth of atmospheric \\(\\ce{CO2}\\) for much of the global ocean, as illustrated by long-term time series records at numerous open-ocean locations and analysis of global surface ocean \\(\\ce{CO2}\\) observational networks. As a result, surface pH and \\(\\ce{CO3^{2-}}\\) are declining, and surface ocean pH is estimated to have dropped on average globally by approximately 0.1 units from the preindustrial era to present, which means there has been an ∼30% increase in hydrogen ion concentration. What? Yes. The oceans are now about 30% more acidic than they were just a few decades ago.\nHence, as \\(\\Omega\\) declines, aragonite in particular becomes more soluble and aragonite calcareous shells of marine life forms become vulnerable to dissolving.\nStudies have already found evidence of extensive shell dissolution of the aragonite shells of the pteropod (small snails) Limacina helicina antarctica in the Southern Ocean, where undersaturation (ie \\(\\ce{Omega_{\\text{ar}}&lt;1})\\) of aragonite is now a reality (Lischka et al. 2025).",

    "text": "3.6 Impacts on diel vertical migration (DVM) of zooplankton\nDiel vertical migration (DVM) is the daily vertical migration up and down the water by zooplankton and other species in both marine and freshwater lake environments. During the night the zooplankton migrate towards the surface in search of the phytoplankton on which they feed. As day comes the sunlight shining from above means that they become visible to predators such as fish who mainly hunt by visual signals. To defend against this they migrate downwards to deeper, darker waters, perhaps some 10s of metres or even a couple of hundred metres further down.\nTHis is illustrated in Figure 3.1 which shows this phenomenon being tracked by satellite. The sacle of DVM means that satellite imaging is the only practicable way to track it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: This echogram illustrates the ascending and descending phases of the diel vertical migration through the water column. The yellows and reds are indicative of the greatest density of animals. Image courtesy of DEEP SEARCH – BOEM, USGS, NOAA\n\n\n\n\n\nThis daily migration plays an important part in the functioning of the so-called biological carbon pump whereby phytoplankton in the surface layers of the ocean photosynthesise and threby capture disovled carbon that has been absorbed from the atmosphoere. The zooplankton prey on these phytoplankton and in maigrating downwards they later excrete this carbon as faeces which, being more dense than seawater, sinks. Thus, this diel migration plays a key role in transferring atmospheric carbon to the ocean bottom where it remains fixed for century long timescales.\nDue to the large number of zooplankton such as krill in the southerh ocean this migration is in fact the greatest on earth in terms of total biomass migrating, bigger even than the large mammal migrations on the African savannahs.\nA concern is that powerful artificial lights at night, shining down from above, may confuse the zooplankton and disrupt this daily migration pattern. Give nthe importance of the migration for the global carbon cycle, this is a potentially grave matter.\n\n\n\n\nAyalon, Inbal, Yaeli Rosenberg, Jennifer I. C. Benichou, Celine Luisa D.

This figure is one to three orders of magnitude greater than the reported mass of all floating plastic debris, although a recent mass-balance study by Harris and co-workers suggests that the shortfall may arise from plastic debris suspended throughout the water column, the so-called marine plastic cloud (2023). This significant influx is primarily driven by the size of coastal populations and, most critically, the quality of municipal solid waste management systems. Middle-income countries, which are experiencing rapid economic growth that outpaces the development of waste management infrastructure, are the largest contributors; 16 of the top 20 contributing nations fall into this category, accounting for 83% of all mismanaged plastic waste.\nRivers serve as a primary conduit for this waste, transporting an estimated 0.41 to 4 million Mt of plastic to the sea annually. The contribution is highly concentrated, with the top 10 river systems—eight of which are in Asia—transporting between 88% and 95% of the total global riverine plastic load. This is due to a nonlinear relationship where large, population-rich catchments deliver a disproportionately high fraction of their mismanaged plastic waste.\nProjections indicate that without significant improvements in waste management, the cumulative quantity of plastic waste available to enter the marine environment will increase by an order of magnitude by 2025. Mitigation efforts focused on substantial infrastructure investment in the top contributing countries and river basins offer the most effective path to drastically reduce plastic pollution. A 50% reduction of mismanaged waste in the top 20 countries could decrease the total input by 41% by 2025, while a 50% load reduction in the top 10 rivers could cut the total river-based contribution by 45%.",

    "text": "4.2 Quantifying the Global Influx of Land-Based Plastic\n\nWhich of the above sources provides an order-of-magnitude estimate of the plastic waste entering the marine environment from terrestrial sources\nDoes it identify the primary drivers and geographic hotspots of pollution.\n\n\n4.2.1 The 2010 Global Estimate\nA 2015 study by Jambeck et al. provided the first rigorous global estimate of land-based plastic waste entering the ocean. The analysis, which linked worldwide data on solid waste, population density, and economic status for 192 coastal countries, produced the following key figures for the year 2010:\n\nTotal Plastic Waste Generated: 275 million metric tons (MT) were generated by the 192 countries, which accounted for 93% of the global population. This figure roughly tracks global plastic resin production (270 million MT in 2010).\nCoastal Plastic Waste: Populations living within 50 km of a coast generated an estimated 99.5 million MT of plastic waste.\nMismanaged Waste: Of the coastal plastic waste, 31.9 million MT were classified as “mismanaged.” This is defined as material that is either littered or inadequately disposed of in systems like open, uncontrolled dumps where it is not fully contained.\nOcean Input: From the mismanaged coastal waste, an estimated 4.8 to 12.7 million MT entered the ocean. This wide range reflects uncertainty in the conversion rates of mismanaged waste to marine debris.\n\nThis estimate of plastic entering the ocean is one to three orders of magnitude greater than the reported mass of plastic observed floating in ocean gyres, pointing to a significant knowledge gap regarding the ultimate fate and location of marine plastic.\n\n\n4.2.2 Geographic Distribution and Key Contributors\nThe mass of mismanaged plastic waste is not evenly distributed globally. It is largely determined by population size and the percentage of waste that is mismanaged. The analysis identified the top 20 countries ranked by the mass of mismanaged plastic waste, which collectively account for 83% of the total.\n\nDominance of Middle-Income Countries: Sixteen of the top 20 contributing countries are classified as middle-income (Upper Middle, Lower Middle), where rapid economic growth and increasing plastic consumption are often not matched by corresponding development in waste management infrastructure. These nations typically have high percentages of mismanaged waste (e.g., China 76%, Indonesia 83%, Vietnam 88%).\nRole of High-Income Countries: High-income countries can also be significant sources due to high per capita waste generation, even with low rates of mismanagement. The United States, for example, ranks 20th. Despite having only a 2% mismanaged waste fraction, its large coastal population and high waste generation rate (2.58 kg per person per day) result in a substantial mass of mismanaged plastic waste (0.28 million MT/year).\n\nThe following table details the estimates for the top 20 countries in 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\nCountry\nEconomic Classification\nCoastal Pop.

    "text": "4.3 Rivers as the Primary Pathway to the Sea\nWhile initial estimates focused on waste generated in coastal zones, further research, for example by Schmid and co-workers (2017) has established that rivers are a major transport pathway, connecting vast inland populations and their waste to the marine environment. They found that:\n\nGlobal River Input Estimate: Based on observed plastic loads, rivers are estimated to transport between 0.41 and 4 million MT of plastic into the sea annually. The wide range of this estimate is due to high uncertainty from sparse and heterogeneous data. *Nonlinear Relationship: The amount of plastic transported by a river is positively but nonlinearly related to the amount of mismanaged plastic waste (MMPW) generated in its catchment. This means that large rivers with population-rich catchments deliver a disproportionately higher fraction of their available MMPW into the sea. This relationship is demonstrated by a log-log linear regression slope greater than 1.\n\n\n4.3.1 Disproportionate Contribution from Major Rivers\nA critical finding is the highly concentrated nature of riverine plastic emissions. The disproportional transport dynamics mean that a small number of rivers are responsible for the vast majority of the global plastic load.\n\nTop 10 Rivers: The 10 top-ranked rivers are calculated to transport 88% to 95% of the total global plastic load that enters the sea via rivers.\nGeographic Concentration: Eight of these top ten highest-load catchments are located in Asia, reflecting the convergence of large populations and high rates of MMPW generation in these regions.\n\nThis concentration suggests that plastic accumulation is a significant issue within river systems themselves, with debris being retained on river banks and in bed sediments before eventual transport to the ocean.",

    "text": "4.4 Future Projections and Mitigation Strategies\nUnder a business-as-usual scenario, the problem of marine plastic pollution is projected to worsen significantly. However, the analytical frameworks used to quantify the problem also allow for the evaluation of potential mitigation strategies.\n\n4.4.1 Business-as-Usual Projections for 2025\nAssuming no improvements in waste management infrastructure, the cumulative quantity of plastic waste available to enter the marine environment from land is predicted to increase by an order of magnitude by 2025. The geographic distribution of mismanaged waste is not expected to change substantially, but the disparity between developing and industrialized countries will grow. For example, mismanaged plastic waste in the United States is projected to increase by 22%, whereas in the top five contributing countries, it is expected to more than double.\n\n\n4.4.2 Evaluating Mitigation Scenarios\nThe concentration of plastic sources in specific countries and river basins presents an opportunity for highly targeted and effective interventions.\n\nImproving Waste Management: This is identified as a paramount strategy. A 50% improvement in waste management (i.e., a 50% reduction in mismanaged waste) in the top 20 countries would decrease the total mass of mismanaged plastic waste by 41% by 2025.\nTargeting Key Rivers: Given their outsized role, focusing on the highest-polluting rivers is highly efficient. Reducing the plastic loads by 50% in the 10 top-ranked rivers would reduce the total global river-based load to the sea by 45%.\nReducing Waste Generation: An alternative strategy involves reducing waste generation and plastic use, primarily targeting higher-income countries. Capping per capita waste generation and the percentage of plastic in the waste stream in the 91 countries that exceed the 2010 average would achieve a 26% decrease by 2025.\nCombined Strategy: A 77% reduction in annual plastic input to the ocean could be realized by 2025 through a combined strategy of achieving 0% mismanaged waste in the 10 top-ranked countries and capping plastic waste generation globally.",

    "text": "4.5 Broader Context and Knowledge Gaps\nThe influx of plastic into the ocean is a direct consequence of the material’s properties, its production trajectory, and its end-of-life management.\n\n4.5.1 The Rise of Plastic Production and Waste\nThe problem is rooted in the exponential growth of plastics production, which has increased from less than 50 million MT per year in the 1970s to 311 million MT in 2014.\n\nPackaging Dominance: The largest market demand for plastics is for packaging materials, which are designed for short-term use and immediate disposal.\nLow Recovery Rates: Despite the recyclability of many plastics, recovery rates remain low. In 2012, only an estimated 8.8% of postconsumer plastics were recovered for recycling in the United States; in Europe, the rate was 30% in 2014.\nPersistence: Plastics are synthetic organic polymers that are resistant to biodegradation, making them a persistent form of litter in the marine environment.\n\n\n\n4.5.2 Environmental Fragmentation\nOnce in the marine environment, particularly when exposed to sunlight at the sea surface or on coastlines, plastics undergo weathering. Exposure to UV radiation initiates photo-oxidative degradation, which weakens the material and leads to fracturing and fragmentation into progressively smaller particles, including microplastics (&lt;5 mm).\n\n\n4.5.3 Key Uncertainties and Research Needs\nWhile the scale of the problem is becoming clearer, significant knowledge gaps remain:\n\nData Scarcity and Standardization: There is a lack of standardized methodologies for sampling and analyzing plastic debris across different marine reservoirs (sea surface, water column, seafloor, etc.), which hinders global-scale assessments.\nRefining Input Estimates: Estimates of plastic inputs from land and rivers are based on models that require more empirical data for validation, including direct measurements of waste transport by rivers, wind, and tides.\nFate of Marine Plastics: The discrepancy between the high estimated inputs and lower observed quantities of floating plastic (the “missing plastic” problem) highlights the need to better understand the fragmentation, transport, and ultimate sinks (e.g., seafloor, biota, sediments) of plastic in the marine environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarris, Peter T., Thomas Maes, Karen Raubenheimer, and J.
