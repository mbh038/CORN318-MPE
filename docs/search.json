    "text": "1.1 Seawater Chemistry\nOcean acidification is one of the most significant threats to coral reefs worldwide. It is a direct consequence of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) levels, which are absorbed by the oceans. This process alters seawater chemistry, with profound impacts on marine ecosystems, particularly coral reefs. Below is an overview of the impact of ocean acidification on coral reefs.\nKey papers for this topic include (Doney et al. 2020), (Mollica et al. 2018), (Orr et al. 2005), (Lischka et al. 2025) and (Royal Society 2005).\nWe see from Figure 1.1, taken from (Doney et al. 2020) that ocean pH levels have dropped by about 0.1 over the last 30-40 years.\nLet us explore how this happens.\nFirst, we note that atmospheric CO2 levels have risen by about 30% in the last 70 years, from around 300 pm to (now, in 2026) around 428 ppm, and are continuing to rise at a rate of about 2ppm per year. This rate of increase is, if anything, becoming greater.\nThe best place to see this is the site of the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, where measurements of atmospheric CO2 have been made since the 1950s. From Figure 1.2 we see that over this period there has been an annual cycle superimposed on a relentlessly rising trend.\nThe oceans absorb about 25-30% of the CO₂ emitted into the atmosphere. When CO₂ dissolves in seawater, it reacts with water to form carbonic acid, which dissociates into bicarbonate ions and hydrogen ions. The increase in atmospheric CO2 means that more CO2 is being absorbed by the oceans which means in turn that the concentration of hydrogen ions in the water is increasing. This means that the ocean is becoming more acidic, with reducd pH.\nAt seawater pH levels (∼8), \\(\\ce{CO2}\\) added to seawater reacts with water to form bicarbonate \\(\\ce{HCO3-}\\) and hydrogen ions \\(\\ce{H+}\\):\n\\[\\ce{CO2 + H2O -&gt; H2CO3- + H+}\\] The release of \\(\\ce{H+}\\) acts to increase acidity and lower seawater pH, defined as\n\\[\\ce{pH}=-\\log_{10}\\ce{[H+]}\\]\nand lower the concentration of carbonate ions , via\n\\[\\ce{CO3^{2-} + H+  -&gt; HCO3-}\\] Acidification impacts will depend on organism responses to multiple, simultaneous chemical changes—increasing \\(\\ce{CO2}\\), \\(\\ce{HCO3-}\\) , and \\(\\ce{H+}\\) and decreasing \\(\\ce{CO3^{2-}}\\). Many types of marine organisms that form shells and skeletons from calcium carbonate (\\(\\ce{CaCO3}\\)) minerals are sensitive to acidification. The solubility of carbonate minerals,\n\\[\\ce{CaCO3 (s) &lt;-&gt; CO3^{2-} + Ca2+}\\]\ncan be expressed as a carbon saturation state\n\\[ \\Omega = \\frac{\\ce{[CO3^{2-}][Ca2+]}}{K_{sp}} \\]\nwhere \\(K_{sp}\\) is the apparent solubility product at a given temperature, salinity and pressure for each mineral form of \\(\\ce{CaCO3}\\). A value of \\(\\Omega\\) &lt; 1 indicates undersaturation with respect to thermodynamic equilibrium, and under those seawater conditions, unprotected carbonate materials will dissolve. The multiple forms of carbonate minerals vary in Ksp and so have different solubilities, with calcite being less soluble than aragonite and amorphous calcium carbonate. As \\(\\ce{CO2}\\) increases, the \\(\\ce{CO3^{2-}}\\) concentration declines because of consumption with \\(\\ce{H+}\\) (Equation 3) causing a decline in \\(\\Omega\\).\nOcean surface waters exchange \\(\\ce{CO2}\\) with the overlying atmosphere via physical gas transfer, and the surface seawater partial pressure, \\(\\ce{pCO2}\\), tends to track the growth of atmospheric \\(\\ce{CO2}\\) for much of the global ocean, as illustrated by long-term time series records at numerous open-ocean locations and analysis of global surface ocean \\(\\ce{CO2}\\) observational networks. As a result, surface pH and \\(\\ce{CO3^{2-}}\\) are declining, and surface ocean pH is estimated to have dropped on average globally by approximately 0.1 units from the preindustrial era to present, which is an ∼30% increase in hydrogen ion concentration.\nHence, as \\(\\Omega\\) declines, aragonite in particular becomes more soluble and aragonite calcareous shells of marine life forms become vulnerable to dissolving.\nStudies have already found evidence of extensive shell dissolution of the aragonite shells of the pteropod (small snails) Limacina helicina antarctica in the Southern Ocean, where undersaturation (ie \\(\\ce{Omega_{\\text{ar}}&lt;1})\\) of aragonite is now a reality (Lischka et al. 2025).",
